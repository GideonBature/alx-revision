My name is Gideon Bature,
I am a student of ALX Software Engineering,
I am lazy and thus love to automate things with Fabric,
Well, you don't need to agree with me whatsoever, I love coding, programming,
I hope that in the nearest future, I will be able to make my own contributions
to the world.... Cheers!!!!!!!!!!!!!
