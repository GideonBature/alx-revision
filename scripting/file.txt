My name is Gideon Bature, from Kaduna State, Nigeria.
I am going to be one of the greatest Software Engineer of all time
Not just by mouth but by putting in my best in building one of the world's must robust systems
I might not be there yet, but I will try my best to make sure I get there
This is my dedication and so help me Lord.
And just incase I forgot, I will also make sure that I help in building the Church and the gate of hell will never recover.
Lord God almighty, thank you for your son.
